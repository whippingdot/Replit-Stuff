# Timeline

This is basically the timeline of what happened when on what day. I did this because I once looked at someone else's code and I saw that they did this, which BTW is an amazing idea ï¿½!

## Day 1 - Tuesday

**HMMMM,** I started the day off by not knowing anything about the weekly challenge. It has been a long time since I last check repl talk, so I checked it out. I was in luck cause I saw that there had been a post 18 hours ago announcing the weekly challenge 5! I instantly created the starting files (like the index.js nodejs set up file) and wrote code for them to start the project. I linked the CSS file and did other stuff too! I didn't really accomplish anything but I did think of an idea of what product I should use (Windows 11) and how the website should look (Windows 11 schemish colors).

## Day 2 - Wednesday

_Ahh_ new day more work :(. Today I started refining my code and making the starting code better. I installed a color picker on my browser and checked the colors used in the website. I decided wether I should use an image for the background, or if I should use one constant color, or if I should use many colors, etc. In the ended I decided using a technique my CSS course taught me in which you would have separate background colors for different `<section>` elements in the code.

## Day 3 - Thursday

I wasn't able to do anything this day unfortunately!

## Day 4 - Friday

I WASN'T ABLE TO DO ANYTHING THIS DAY EITHER AAAAAAA!

## Day 5 - Saturday

I implemented the features I thought of on Wednesday...I wasn't able to finish them the other days cause I had lots of other stuff to do(AAAAA). I used the [Windows 11 pre-given backgrounds](https://wccftech.com/you-can-now-download-windows-11-wallpaper/) (which look awesome BTW from personal usage) as an image for the header background. I was also deciding at the end of the day if I should add picture backgrounds to the pros and cons.

## Day 6 - Sunday

I redid my project in large scale, but still made sure I did a lot of work so I didn't have a lot to do on Monday. All I have left on Monday is to create some grids, finish Pros and Cons, and do the dark mode button. I really hope I finish my project in time and submit it!

## Day 7 - Monday

So, today was the day. Anyway, (future self talking) that day I did a LOT of work at night! I added lots more HTML (content), some CSS to create a grid which held all the new UI changes, lots of CSS on Images, and a few more things. I wrapped up the project like at 10:30PM IST and was going to submit it, when unfortunately my internet got cut (after a specific time my dad cuts it automatically). I couldn't submit the project! I WAS IN PANIC AAAAAAAAAAAA!!

## Day 8 - Tuesday

Today I should dub the stress day. I pinged TheDrone like 7 times and asked him to forgive me and asked him if he could take my submission (this was like 9 hours after the results came). He didn't reply until like two days later (I said, future self). His reply then was no... :( But anyway, this day I didn't really do anything on the project, just had stress!

## Day 9 - Wednesday

This is still before he replied. So anyway, I decided to continue working on my project **in VSCode** until he replied. I wasn't going to push any changes cause I wasn't evil or a cheater. The first thing I did was ditch nodejs. Then I added some smooth effects and made the project just generally better. I also added a button for Dark mode but didn't finish it.

## Day 10 - Thursday

I think this is when he replied. He told me that he would've given me a 7 and that he won't take the submission. Instead of doing the Weekly 6, I decided to improve my submission to up the score at least by one. I finished the button for Dark mode (added hover effects, added an icon, added a changing icon whenever you press it and a changing background) and separated all the style elements to be changed when pressing the button and moved them into a separate file called 'light.css'. I then reversed all those colors at first and added them to 'dark.css', but didn't like it and instead got new colors for 'dark.css'. I also added an event listener which change the second file being linked to when pressing the button (meaning exchanging dark.css and light.css while style.css was always being linked). I then pinged TheDrone to tell me how much he would rate my project now, and he gave it a (drumroll please) 8! That would've landed me on the top 10 in the leaderboard! WOOHOO!

## Day 11 - Friday

I decided to try to share a post, but couldn't in the end. I instead added the favicon (which only worked in VSCode for the first few hours but after some time worked in replit too) and transferred all my VSCode changes to replit. I also used that devtools feature to check how responsive my website was, and it only worked till 370px unfortunately. I decided that later I would fix that. I also identified a bug in my code and decided to fix it the next day ;).

## Day 12 - Saturday

Yet to do anything

<!-- NOTE: The dates from after Monday have the things I did on them all mixed up - I don't remember -->
