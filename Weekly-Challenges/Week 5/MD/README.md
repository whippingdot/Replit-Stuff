# Timeline

This is basically the timeline of what happened when on what day. I did this because I once looked at someone else's code and I saw that they did this, which BTW is an amazing idea ï¿½!

## Day 1 - Tuesday

**HMMMM,** I started the day off by not knowing anything about the weekly challenge. It has been a long time since I last check repl talk, so I checked it out. I was in luck cause I saw that there had been a post 18 hours ago announcing the weekly challenge 5! I instantly created the starting files (like the index.js nodejs set up file) and wrote code for them to start the project. I linked the CSS file\* and did other stuff too! I didn't really accomplish anything but I did think of an idea of what product I should use (Windows 11) and how the website should look (Windows 11 schemish colors).

## Day 2 - Wednesday

_Ahh_ new day more work :(. Today I started refining my code and making the starting code better. I installed a color picker on my browser and checked the colors used in the website. I decided wether I should use an image for the background, or if I should use one constant color, or if I should use many colors, etc. In the ended I decided using a technique my CSS course taught me in which you would have separate background colors for different `<section>` elements in the code.

## Day 3 - Thursday

I wasn't able to do anything this day unfortunately!

## Day 4 - Friday

I WASN'T ABLE TO DO ANYTHING THIS DAY EITHER AAAAAAA!

## Day 5 - Saturday

I implemented the features I thought of on Wednesday...I wasn't able to finish them the other days cause I had lots of other stuff to do(AAAAA). I used the [Windows 11 pre-given backgrounds](https://wccftech.com/you-can-now-download-windows-11-wallpaper/) (which look awesome BTW from personal usage) as an image for the header background. I was also deciding at the end of the day if I should add picture backgrounds to the pros and cons.

## Day 6 - Sunday

I redid my project in large scale, but still made sure I did a lot of work so I didn't have a lot to do on Monday. All I have left on Monday is to create some grids, finish Pros and Cons, and do the dark mode button. I really hope I finish my project in time and submit it!

## Day 7 - Monday

The FINAL DAY is here...I have a lot of work cut out for me today! I need to finish the main page, and create the dark and light mode button. I hope I finish everything and submit it on time!
