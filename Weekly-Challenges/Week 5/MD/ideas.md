So I randomly get cool ideas for me to implement in the project - here they are!

1. Maybe try to create a sliding in effect from sides for the cons and pros?
2. Add images next to most of the cons and pros
3. Add a dark mode button in the bottom right as a static. The moon and sun will be images. The static button will be circular (if possible) meaning it will always stay at the bottom right on the page. If you press it there should be an event listener in javascript which changes one out of two css files. There will be three CSS files in total so one will be all the things that should always stay the same, and the other two will be the dark and light mode ones which will switch with the press of a button.
