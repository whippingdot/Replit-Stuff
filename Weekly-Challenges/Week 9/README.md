# INTRO

This month's challenges were based on math so I was excited to see how I would preform. The first challenge was to make something with linear equations, and I choose a solver, so here it is!

# NOTE

Wait while doing this on Saturday, I realized that the easy way out was to just try every possible number to see what the variable was! But that would be too easy and kinda like cheating so I decided I would do it the hard way and do it the normal way us humans do - transposing...

## Day 1 - Friday

Well today, so far at least, I don't really _understand_ the challenge. I left a comment but I am yet to get a reply. For now I have just typed out the basic material, and started checking if the linear equation was valid or not. OH! I got a reply and now I understand. The end of the day now - I finished a **lot of progress** lol finished like **half** the project (though most that I did was the _easy_ parts...)!

## Day 2 - Saturday

Well, start of the day and I separated both sides of the equation. This was easy but now I have the complex part of evaluating both sides witH PEDMAS and evaluating variables too... (┬┬﹏┬┬)

## Day 3 - Sunday

Well I have told myself for some time that finding the procedure to a problem is harder than coding it, and that is true, but there is a third step in the middle harder - thinking of how to implement the procedure in code before typing it out. For this week finding out how to move values to the other side of the equation and changing the signs and finding out how to isolate the variable on one side will be the problem... Anyway my speech of wisdom out of the way, today so far I have finished my last check of seeing if the equation given is valid. Pretty sweet, but now I have hard parts coming my way. I have to find out how to simplify both sides of the equation. This includes simplifying like `3x + 3 + 2x + 6`. I have to somehow loop through the whole string, take the values that are similar together, and then simplify those and put them back in the string. Wait! That is a good idea! But still it is gonna be hard to implement that so lemme see if I can do it by the end of today! I don't remember what I did at the end of the day (the next day me talking) but I don't think I made much progress.

## Day 4 - Monday

I completely wrote a method for simplifying both sides of the equation (which took a **LONG** time) but quickly realized it wasn't following PEDMAS. Then I had to brainstorm for an hour at least to decide what to do next - and then I thought about creating functions for all the methods in the end (from a very confusing stackOverFlow answer in which I saw him use `multiplication()` and got an idea to create those functions cause they weren't built in). I wrote a lot of code for the multiplication one but couldn't finish it. The days are getting tight and I hope to finish all the rest functions tomorrow (though I don't know if I can because I have a hard exam the day after). If I don't I might have to end up just submitting the program that simplifies linear expressions in one variable **to the point** where there is one thing on one side (like `5x + 4`) and something else on the other (like `2`). That would be sad but it would have to work.

## Day 5 - Tuesday

Bruh I literally got nothing done today because of the exam. I have to do everything on Wednesday :(.

## Day 6 - Wednesday

While I finished all the functions for multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, I wasn't able to add the simplifying process into the main code. Also I recognized a lot of errors in my code too which means I might have to fix those instead of moving forward with the program... I don't know how I will finish it tomorrow.

## Day 7 - Thursday

Well today is the last day, I somehow have to finish the whole program, including the errors and everything. I probably won't be able to do this so my guess is that I will submit a copy with everything **except the moving everything to the other side and simplifying it.** I might have a chance to finish it, but let us see what this day brings us.
